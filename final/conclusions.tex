\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

The primary goal of this research was to select a chromatic coloring algorithm that could be used in a part
consolidation tool for AD designers.  The tool needs to handle input FR design graphs with up to \(20\)
vertices and moderate (\(50\%\)) edge density and must be able to deliver an answer in under one minute.

Three algorithms were considered:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Christofides Algorithm~(\sectionname~\ref{sec:sub:christofides}) with the
  Wang improvements~(\sectionname~\ref{sec:sub:wang})
\item The Zykov algorithm~(\sectionname~\ref{sec:sub:zykov})
\item A new proposed algorithm~(\sectionname~\ref{sec:algorithm})
\end{enumerate}

These three algorithms were originally compared using empirical runtime complexity values obtained from a random
graph analysis.  For the purposes of this analysis, a step was defined to be a call to a routine that performs all
of the necessary processing for a state in an algorithms state tree.  The results are shown in
\tablename~\ref{tab:rtresults}.

\begin{table}[H]

  \caption{Runtime Complexity Comparison for the Three Chromatic Coloring Algorithms}
  \label{tab:rtresults}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
    \hline
    ALGORITHM & RUNTIME COMPLEXITY \\
    \hline
    Christofides/Wang & \(\BO(1.0045^{n^2})\) \\
    \hline
    Zykov & \(\BO(3.3^n)\) \\
    \hline
    Proposed & \(\BO(1.0103^{n^2})\) \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Assuming that number of states processed translates to runtime duration, tt would seem that the Christofides/Wang
algorithm has a slight speed advantage.  However, it was noted that the initial chromatic number lower and upper
bound estimate test that was presented as part of the new proposed algorithm could be added to the two well-known
algorithms.  Thus, a runtime duration test was performed limited to random graphs where the estimated lower and
upper bounds do not match.  The results presented in \sectionname~\ref{sec:random} showed that the three algorithms
took exactly the same amount of time to produce a solution, which was well under the one minute requirement.  This
led to certain ideas about the nature of uncoupled information and inherently intractable problems that were
discussed in \sectionname~\ref{sec:sub:info}.

Although all three algorithms are suitable for the desired design tool, the simplicity of the basic Zykov algorithm
and its efficient use of space indicate that it is the best choice.
