\section{Graph Theory}

This section presents the concepts, definitions, and theorems from the field of graph theory that are needed in the
development of the two algorithms.  This material is primarily taken from the textbooks used \cite{chartrand} and
class notes compiled by the author during his undergraduate and graduate graph theory classes at SJSU.
