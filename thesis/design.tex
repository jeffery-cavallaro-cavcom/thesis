\section{Axiomatic Design}

Axiomatic design as a design framework was developed in the late \(20^{th}\) century by Professor Nam P. Suh while
at MIT and the NSF \cite{suh}.  This was in response to concern in the engineering community that \emph{design} was
primarily creative endeavor with very little in the way of scientific discipline.  In the words of Professor Suh:
\begin{quote}
  From prehistoric periods, humanity has designed and made hunting implements, shelters, and clothing.  It might have
  preceding the development of natural sciences by scores of centuries.  Yet, to this day, design is being done
  intuitively as an art.  It is one of the few technical areas where experience is more important than formal
  education.
\end{quote}
This lament is well recognized by Mathematicians and Math Educators. Questions like, ``What makes someone good at
solving math problems?'' and ``What constitutes a good proof?'' have led to comparisons of intuition versus
pattern matching.  On a day-to-day basis, many of these questions have been answered by universally accepted methods
of proof: direct, contradition, implication, equivalences, equality and subsets.
